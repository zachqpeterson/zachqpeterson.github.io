		<p class="fullDescription">Nihility is a game engine made from scratch. I've made my own data structures, memory
			allocator, math library, UI system, and job system.
			I also try to get as low level as possible by making my own file stream and using Raw Input. This is an
			ongoing project that I will likely continue for years to come.

			Currently I have a fully dynamic rendergraph system where you can completely customize how everything is rendered. 
			I also recently added basic shadow mapping, I plan on upgrading it to a more sophisticated version with cascades and the newer technique of moment shadow mapping.
